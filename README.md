This project set out to make a Onewheel alternative for under $400. Hoverwheel uses an old hoverboard for the motors and almost all of the electronics. 

An ESP32 provides high speed balance control and control parameter adjustments over BLE.
This project does not use VESC and instead the cotnrol algorithm has been written from scratch.

I am still working on a full writeup about the development of this project and will post a link here when done.

## App
I wrote an iOS app to control the BLE Paramters as well as provide sensor data such as battery voltage, speed, and motor duty cycle.
